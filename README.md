### Hi, I’m Hamza 👋

**Backend & Distributed/Decentralized Systems Engineer** focused on decentralized, scalable infrastructure. I work primarily with **Go** and **Node.js**, building resilient backends, P2P networks, and cloud-native systems.

Currently working at **NuNet** as a **Senior Software Engineer** and **P2P/Network Engineer**. [@nunet.io](https://nunet.io) in the [DMS](https://gitlab.com/nunet/device-management-service) project to enable a decentralized network of compute resources.

### 🔗 Decentralized Systems & P2P

- **NuNet** – Engineered a **libp2p/QUIC-based VPN subnet** in Go for resilient decentralized networking. (https://gitlab.com/derrandz)  
- **Celestia Labs** – Contributed to **P2P layer research** and **data availability node** optimizations; Contributed to **decentralized end-to-end testing** for blockchain clients.  
- **Pocket Network** – Developed **v1 of the node structure** in Go, including the **P2P layer** and **telemetry infrastructure** to ensure 100% data correctness.

### ⚙️ High-Throughput Backends & Infrastructure

- Built a **real-time traffic analysis system** handling **11M+ requests/hour** (Golang) with custom caching and analytics dashboards.  
- Architected **telecom microservices** (Node.js/PostgreSQL) with scalable state management.  
- Bootstrapped **Kubernetes clusters** (AWS/EKS) and wired **Prometheus/Grafana** observability.  
- Advocate for **12-factor apps**, **SOLID design**, and **TDD** to keep systems maintainable and observable.
