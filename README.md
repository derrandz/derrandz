### Hi, I’m Hamza 👋

**Backend & Distributed/Decentralized Systems Engineer** focused on decentralized, scalable infrastructure. I work primarily with **Go** and **Node.js**, building resilient backends, P2P networks, and cloud-native systems.

Currently working at **NuNet** as a **Senior Software Engineer** and **P2P/Network Engineer**. [@nunet.io](https://nunet.io) in the [DMS](https://gitlab.com/nunet/device-management-service) project to enable a decentralized network of compute resources.

---

### Primary Stack

- **Languages**: Go (+7 years), Node.js (+5 years), TypeScript/JavaScript (+5 years)
- **Cloud & Infra**: AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, Docker
- **Messaging & Streaming**: AWS SQS, RabbitMQ, Kafka
- **Datastores**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, BadgerDB, CloverDB, LevelDB, etc.
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Frontend**: React, MobX, Zustand, Redux, etc... (I'm not a frontend engineer (_anymore, spent 4 years doing fullstack previously_), but I can build a frontend if needed.)

### 🔗 Decentralized Systems & P2P

- **NuNet** – Engineered a **libp2p/QUIC-based VPN subnet** in Go for resilient decentralized networking. (https://gitlab.com/derrandz)
- **NuNet** - Active maintainer of our object capability model security library (A copy is available -but not ready- [UCAN](https://github.com/depinkit/ucan)) and the actor model over libp2p implementation
- **Celestia Labs** – Contributed to **P2P layer research** and **data availability node** optimizations; Contributed to **decentralized end-to-end testing** for blockchain clients.  
- **Pocket Network** – Developed **v1 of the node structure** in Go, including the **P2P layer** and **telemetry infrastructure** to ensure 100% data correctness.

### ⚙️ High-Throughput Backends & Infrastructure

- Built a **real-time traffic analysis system** handling **11M+ requests/hour** (Golang) with custom caching and analytics dashboards.  
- Architected **telecom microservices** (Node.js/PostgreSQL) with scalable state management.  
- Bootstrapped **Kubernetes clusters** (AWS/EKS) and wired **Prometheus/Grafana** observability.  
- Advocate for **12-factor apps**, **SOLID design**, and **TDD** to keep systems maintainable and observable.

---

### 🧩 Fullstack & Leadership

- Led frontend teams with **React/MobX** while driving backend microservices.  
- As **VP of Engineering**, hired teams, introduced **Agile/DevOps** practices, and set up **SLO-focused workflows**.

---

### 🔭 What I’m most excited about

- P2P networks, data availability, and decentralized coordination.  
- Clean, testable architectures that scale under real-world load.  
- Bridging robust backends with thoughtful, performant frontends.
- High-throughput backend development.
